        <h3>To Dearest Vaidarbhi</h3>
        <p>This is just to say "THANKYOU" for wishing me on my birthday.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>Now you may be thinking why I opted this way? Well, the simplest answer that I can give I wanted to thank <strong>one</strong> of my <strong>special friend</strong> in some of the way that I prefer and one more thing I owe the credit of designing this.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Time-Travel</h3>
        <p style="background-color:Black">Its going to be an year when I first messaged you on Insta, as always your reply didn't came and you may not be knowing that I was very much scared after texting you and today I can speak you without thinking.All the memorable chats that I can remember, make me always happy. I am not going into the detailed description warna senti ho jaunga. The day when I had asked you for your mobile number, after texting I was scared alot but your reply came in a possesive way, and though I cool down after that.Telling truly this one "if I would have a time travelling machine I would go back <strong>one-year</strong> just to rejoice every single text with you".<br> <strong style="color:Red">Waise ek baat tumhari abhi tak yaad hai <q>The longer u wait, the hotter u date</q> kab aaega woh din ye toh pta ni, lekin jab aae jaisa tumne kaha hai waisa hi aae.</strong></p>
        <hr>
        <h3>An Important Request</h3>

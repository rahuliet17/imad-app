        <h3>To Dearest Vaidarbhi</h3>
        <p>This is just to say "THANKYOU" for wishing me on my birthday "BETU".</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>Now you may be thinking why I opted this way? Well, the simplest answer that I can give I wanted to thank one of my special friend in some of the way that I prefer and one more thing I owe the credit of designing this. Don't take this as a wrong.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Time-Travel</h3>
        <p style="background-color:Black">Its going to be an year when I first messaged you on Insta, as always your reply didn't came and you may not be knowing that I was very much scared after texting you and today I can speak you without thinking.All the memorable chats that I can remember, make me always happy. I am not going into the detailed description warna senti ho jaunga. The day when I had asked you for your mobile number, after texting I was scared alot but your reply came in a possesive way, and though I cool down after that.Telling truly this one "if I would have a time travelling machine I would go back one year" just to rejoice every single text with you.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>An Important Advice</h3>
        <p>Kabhi kabhi hume bhi yaad kar liya karo, aur whatsapp pe messages yuhin seen karke naa chhoda karo, ho sake to reply bhi kar diya karo. Waise bhi ek baat tumhari abhi tak yaad hai "The longer u wait the hotter u date" bas isi din ka intezaar hai ab toh.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Not Intensionally</h3>
        <p>
            I am also Sorry if it made you to feel you annoying.Well this all I can do is sitting 100s of km far from you and thank you in this way.
            Again I am saying don't take it in a wrong way, I just got an idea to do so, so I had done that.
